This is a simple text-based game where a player can choose and interact with one of two soldier characters. The player is presented with a list of soldiers and can select one to play with. The selected soldier has four attributes: name, armor, hit points (hp), and damage. The player can perform two actions: heal the soldier, increasing their hp by 10, or inflict damage, decreasing their hp by 10. If the soldier's hp reaches 0, the game ends with the message "You are dead man". The game continues until the player's selected soldier has zero hit points.
